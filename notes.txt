Nodes --> processes
We have two nodes 
- laptop node (or commander, tell the catamaran what to do while in remote control)
    - Joystick Module: reads input and then sends information to the Pi
    - Telemetry (getting data back from the PI)
    - GUI (graphical user interface)
- Raspberry Pi node (catamaran)
    - Remote Control (command parser)
    - Controlling Thrusters (PWM, PWM rate limiter)
        - Command is called *request* Thrusters because it doesn't immediately set it.
    - Advanced:
        - GPS
        - Computer vision
